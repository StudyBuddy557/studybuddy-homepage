Understanding your TEAS score is crucial because nursing programs don't just look at the total number—they look at your **Academic Preparedness Level**.

## The 5 Scoring Levels

1.  **Advanced (92-100%):** You are in the top 1% of applicants.
2.  **Exemplary (80-91%):** Highly competitive. Most accepted students fall here.
3.  **Proficient (59-79%):** The minimum requirement for most ADN programs.
4.  **Basic (41-58%):** Likely requires remediation.
5.  **Developmental (\<40%):** Significant gaps in core knowledge.

## How is the Score Calculated?
The TEAS uses "Item Response Theory" (IRT). This means not all questions are weighted equally. Harder questions might be worth more in specific contexts, though ATI does not release the exact algorithm.

> **Pro Tip:** Never leave a question blank. There is no penalty for guessing.

## When Do You Get Results?
* **In-Person (PSI Center):** Immediately upon completion.
* **Online (At-Home):** Within 24-48 hours.
