# Mitochondria

The **mitochondria** is often called the "powerhouse of the cell" because it produces ATP through cellular respiration.

## Key Functions

- Produces ATP (adenosine triphosphate)
- Regulates cellular metabolism
- Involved in cell signaling and apoptosis

## On the TEAS 7 Exam

You will likely be asked to:
- Identify the mitochondria's primary function
- Describe its role in cellular respiration
- Recognize it as an organelle found in eukaryotic cells
